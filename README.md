# DocuVerse: Advanced Document Information Extraction Research Library

A comprehensive research library for evaluating and comparing different document information extraction methods, from baseline few-shot approaches to novel dynamic graph-RAG techniques.

## Overview

This library provides a systematic framework for testing and comparing various document information extraction approaches:

1. **🎯 Unified Few-shot Extraction**: Hybrid extraction + classification with dynamic example loading
2. **🔍 Vector RAG**: Advanced retrieval-augmented generation with state-of-the-art optimizations
3. **🕸️ Graph RAG**: Knowledge graph-based extraction with dynamic subgraph generation
4. **🧠 Reasoning Enhancement**: Verifier-augmented CoT/ReAct with schema validation
5. **⚡ Dynamic Graph-RAG**: Novel adaptive retrieval expansion based on verifier uncertainty

## 🏆 Latest Achievements

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd docuverse

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start: Unified Extraction

```python
from docuverse.core.config import LLMConfig
from docuverse.extractors.few_shot import FewShotExtractor

# Configure LLM
llm_config = LLMConfig(
    provider="ollama",
    model_name="llama2",
    base_url="http://localhost:11434"
)

# Initialize unified extractor with auto-loading
extractor = FewShotExtractor(
    llm_config=llm_config,
    schema_path="schemas/contracts_schema_hybrid.json",
    auto_load_labels=True  # Loads examples from data/labels/
)

# Extract and classify in one operation
document = {"content": "Contract with monthly payments..."}
result = extractor.extract(document)

# Result includes both extraction and classification
print(result)
# {
#   "fields": {
#     "payment_terms": {
#       "extracted_content": "Payments are due every month",
#       "classification": "monthly"
#     },
#     "customer_name": {
#       "extracted_content": "John Doe"
#     }
#   }
# }
```

## Schema-Driven Hybrid Processing

The extractor automatically handles different field types based on your schema:

```json
{
  "field": {
    "payment_terms": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["monthly", "yearly", "one-time"],
      "description": "The payment terms for the contract.",
      "enumDescriptions": {
        "monthly": "Payment is due every month.",
        "yearly": "Payment is due once a year.",
        "one-time": "Payment is made in a single transaction."
      }
    },
    "customer_name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The name of the customer for the contract."
    }
  }
}
```

**Fields with `enum`**: Hybrid extraction + classification
**Fields without `enum`**: Pure extraction

## Auto-Loading Examples

Place your training examples in `data/labels/` folder:

```
data/
├── labels/
│   ├── contract1_label.json    # Ground truth labels
│   ├── contract2_label.json
│   └── ...
├── contract1.txt               # Optional: corresponding documents
└── contract2.txt
```

The extractor automatically:
- ✅ Loads all JSON files from `data/labels/`
- ✅ Matches with corresponding document files
- ✅ Generates synthetic documents if needed
- ✅ Provides few-shot examples for better accuracy

## Research Methods

### 1. Few-Shot Baseline
- Traditional prompt engineering with examples
- Chunking strategies for long documents
- Token optimization

### 2. Vector RAG
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + semantic search)
- Reranking with cross-encoders
- Adaptive chunk sizing

### 3. Graph RAG
- Knowledge graph construction
- Entity-centric subgraph retrieval
- Cypher-like query generation

### 4. Dynamic Graph-RAG (Novel)
- Adaptive retrieval expansion
- Uncertainty-based fallback mechanisms
- Lightweight KG for entity-centric queries

### 5. Hybrid Extraction + Classification
- Extract exact text content from documents
- Classify extracted content using enum definitions
- Single operation for both extraction and categorization
- Support for structured data parsing (amounts, contacts, etc.)

## Hybrid Extraction Examples

```python
# Payment terms: Extract text AND classify
{
  "payment_terms": {
    "extracted_text": "Net 30 days from invoice date",
    "classification": "standard"  # vs "non_standard", "unknown"
  }
}

# Contract value: Extract amount AND classify tier
{
  "contract_value": {
    "extracted_text": "$75,000 annually",
    "amount": 75000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "classification": "medium_value"  # vs "small", "high_value", "enterprise"
  }
}
```
